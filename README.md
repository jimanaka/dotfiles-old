# Dotfiles
Portable configuration files for standing up new machines. Mainly for Arch Linux, but I may add instructions for other distros, idk.

* [Getting Started](#getting-started)

## Getting Started
### Installing Full Repo
The following instructions were adapted from [these instructions](https://www.ackama.com/what-we-think/the-best-way-to-store-your-dotfiles-a-bare-git-repository-explained/) by Gabrielle Young. Refer to the link for more background information on this process.

1. Add .dotfiles to the global Git ingore so the repo does not track itself
```
$ echo ".dotfiles" >> $HOME/.gitignore
```


## Vim
